# Widget Examples

## Description

This project is a collection of basic examples demonstrating how to use various widgets in Python's Tkinter library. The examples include labels, buttons, entries, text boxes, spinboxes, scales, checkbuttons, radiobuttons, and listboxes. These simple, interactive examples are designed to help beginners understand how to implement and interact with these common GUI components.

The code provides a hands-on approach to learning how to create and configure widgets, handle user input, and respond to events. Each widget is accompanied by functions that show how to retrieve and manipulate the data entered or selected by the user.

**Note**: This project was inspired by Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

## Features

- **Label**: Displays text that can be dynamically updated.
- **Button**: Triggers a function when clicked.
- **Entry**: Allows the user to input a single line of text.
- **Text**: Allows the user to input multiple lines of text.
- **Spinbox**: Lets the user select from a range of values.
- **Scale**: A slider to select a value within a specified range.
- **Checkbutton**: A toggle button that indicates an on/off state.
- **Radiobutton**: Allows the user to select one option from a set.
- **Listbox**: Displays a list of items, allowing the user to select one.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations).

### How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python widget_examples.py
   ```

3. Interact with the various widgets in the window that appears. You can click buttons, enter text, select options, and more.
4. Observe the printed outputs in the console, which demonstrate how the widget interactions work.

### Customization

You can customize the widgets by:
- **Changing Text**: Modify the text labels, button labels, and other displayed text directly in the code.
- **Adjusting Layout**: Rearrange the widgets by changing the order of the `.pack()` calls or using different geometry managers like `.grid()` or `.place()`.
- **Adding Functionality**: Enhance the project by adding more widgets or expanding the existing ones with additional functionality.
